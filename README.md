# Lab11 Dicitonaries!

This lab has two parts. 

### Part I 
Make a phonebook app similar to the birthday example. Basically just copy and past. 

### Part II
Create a tally system that will keep a record of how many times your friends (and you) have won at a particular game, say tic-tac-toe. You should create a menu that has two options:
1. View the number of times a person has won. If the person is not on the list, your program should add them to the dictionary and set their tally to 0.
2. Add a tally to a particular person. If the person is not on the list, your program should add them to the dictionary and set their tally to 1.
